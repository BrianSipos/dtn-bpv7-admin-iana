This document clarifies that a Bundle Protocol Version 7 agent is intended to use an IANA sub-registry for Administrative Record types.
It also makes a code point reservation for private or experimental use.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
The earlier Bundle Protocol (BP) Version 6 (BPv6) defined an IANA sub-registry for Administrative Record type code points under <xref target="IANA-BP"/>.
When Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) was published in <xref target="RFC9171"/> it included an explicit table of Administrative Record types but made no mention of an IANA registry nor a requirement for BPv7 agents to be extensible in how they handle Administrative Record types.
The BPv7 specification also did not discriminate between code point reservations and unassigned ranges for Administrative Record types.
      </t>
      <t>
This document updates BPv7 to explicitly use the IANA Administrative Record type registry in <xref target="sec-bpv7-admin-type"/>.
This document makes a reservation of the zero value for consistency with BPv6.
This document also makes a reservation of high-valued code points for private or experimental use to avoid collisions with assigned code points.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>Scope</name>
        <t>
This document describes updates to the IANA Administrative Record type sub-registry and how a BPv7 agent is supposed to use that registry for identifying Administrative Record types.
        </t>
        <t>
This document does not specify how BPv6 and BPv7 can interoperate for overlapping code points or how a specific code point is to be interpreted either similarly or differently between Bundle Protocol versions.
It is up to each individual Administrative Record type specification to define how it relates to each BP version.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

      <name>Administrative Record Types Registry</name>
      <t>
This document updates the requirements in <xref section="6.1" target="RFC9171"/> to use an existing IANA registry and updates that sub-registry in <xref target="sec-iana-bp-admin-type"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
The code point allocated in Annex D of <xref target="CCSDS-BP"/> was never added to the IANA registry.
To avoid a collision, this document adds that allocation to the registry.
      </t>
      <t>
Instead of using the explicit list of types in <xref section="6.1" target="RFC9171"/>, a BPv7 administrative element <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> interpret administrative record type code values in accordance with the IANA "Bundle Administrative Record Types" sub-registry under <xref target="IANA-BP"/> for entries having a "Bundle Protocol Version" of 7.
      </t>
      <t>
If an administrative element receives a not-well-formed ADU or an administrative record type code which is not able to be processed by the element, the record <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be ignored by the element.
The processing of a received administrative record ADU does not affect the fact that the bundle itself was delivered to the administrative element or any related BPA processing of (e.g. status reports on) the enveloping bundle.

This document does not define any requirements or structures which introduce new security considerations.

The existing security considerations of <xref target="RFC9171"/> still apply when using the IANA Administrative Record Types sub-registry.

This specification modifies a BPv6 sub-registry to extend BPv7.

Within the "Bundle Protocol" registry <xref target="IANA-BP"/>, the "Bundle Administrative Record Types" sub-registry has been updated to include a leftmost "Bundle Protocol Version" column.
New entries have been added and existing entries have been updated to have BP versions as in the following table.
This document makes no changes to the registration procedures for this sub-registry.
